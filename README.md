# hybrid-metaheuristic-fs-ml
Codebase and data for EOCS


Research & Development of a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, Equilibrium optimizer with Cuckoo search algorithm `(EOCS)` to improve the quality of the search optimization and for feature selection with wrapper method and KNN to solve hyperdimensionality in data. 

Applied statistical Friedman test to compare the 16 metaheuristic models to evaluate the robustness of `EOCS` considering metrics such as accuracy, fitness and processing time.

All 18 datasets included with this repo are open source.
